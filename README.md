# Opera-data-publication-project
This is a project for publishing a collection of plates in OMERO for Stephanie Mohr. 
Stephanie has a bunch of Opera data that she wants to publish. OMERO seemed like a good fit. In this project I will attempt to document what I am doing and keep all the scripts and code in one place.
